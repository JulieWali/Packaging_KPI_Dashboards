During my time at Carrefour Global Sourcing, I led a project to develop and launch a packaging data collection tool. I was responsible for designing the data collection template and overseeing the tool's rollout. After the launch, I created dashboards with key performance indicators (KPIs) to track packaging details. These KPIs were aligned with Carrefour's four sustainability objectives: eliminating unnecessary packaging, improve recyclability, using sustainable paper and cardboard, and incorporating recycled plastic.
